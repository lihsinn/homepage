  //   <div className={"page_content_content"}>
  //     In the context of the increasing aging population, design for the elderly
  //     has become more and more important. Many products have taken into
  //     consideration the elder-friendly design. However, the actual usability in
  //     real practice has not been sufficiently investigated. This study aims to
  //     tackle the problem and examine the practical usability of such a design
  //     through an experimental way. In particular, the Alipay app was selected as
  //     the target product to test. Its normal mode and elder-friendly mode were
  //     compared. For this purpose, we designed a set of experiments with 16
  //     participants who are older than 45 years old and randomly divided them
  //     into two groups. One group used the normal mode, and the other used the
  //     elder-friendly mode. The eye tracker of Tobii Pro Glasses 2 was employed
  //     to collect participants’ eye movement data on these interfaces. Moreover,
  //     user interviews, user behavior observation, and System Usability Scale
  //     were jointly adopted to collect related user behavior information and
  //     subjective experience evaluation. Based on the qualitative and
  //     quantitative data, the differences between the two modes in the dimensions
  //     of information architecture, interface design, and task flow were
  //     identified. The results show that the current elder-friendly design cannot
  //     effectively facilitate usability for elderly users. Furthermore, the
  //     corresponding transdisciplinary design strategies were proposed to help
  //     with the improvement in design for the elderly.
