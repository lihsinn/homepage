  //       BDI Model for Simulating Governance in Decentralized Autonomous

  //     Agent-based modeling is widely used for geospatial modeling in the field
  //     of urban planning, including transportation, epidemic transmission, etc.,
  //     but is rarely applied to social relations modeling that leads to urban
  //     policy or organizational design. In the web3.0 era, the Decentralized
  //     autonomous organization (DAO) has emerged as a new form of organization
  //     that computerized the rules of governance and is controlled by
  //     organization members based on the immutable and decentralized smart
  //     contract. Due to its novel structures and functions, the number of active
  //     DAOs is exploding, expecting to promote societies’ democracy, fairness,
  //     and trustfulness. Besides, DAO’s complexity and underlying mechanism
  //     present challenges for founders seeking evidence of the rationality of
  //     their initial governance designs. Although DAO’s governance design has
  //     received academic and practitioner attention, there is still a lack of
  //     theories or simulation models ensuring that its governance is valid.
  //     Besides, existing models in the literature did not consider the
  //     heterogeneity and social connections in DAO’s communities. Therefore, the
  //     agent-based modeling(ABM) and Belief-Desire-Intention(BDI) paradigm become
  //     a natural choice for governance simulation considering different
  //     stakeholders.
  //     <br />
  //     This article presents an agent-based modeling approach with the aim of
  //     simulating individual decision-making, the voting process, and the token
  //     economy in a DAO based on the GAMA platform. The
  //     Belief-Desire-Intention(BDI) agent in GAMA is utilized to introduce DAO
  //     members’ interaction and individual features, that have not been
  //     considered in existing literature, into this model. In the first place,
  //     the goal of DAO members is to maximize the token amount, and we model such
  //     a multiagent system as an incomplete information game theory. On top of
  //     that, we explore how will information exchange, social relations, and
  //     personal inner state influence members’ voting and decision-making. Then,
  //     the agents were presented as existing DAO members or potential members by
  //     abstracting their various characteristics into personas. Besides, this
  //     approach also models token trading through brown motion in a free market
  //     with member entry and exit. Apart from that, our model builds indicators
  //     of governance performance, including user engagement, governance equity,
  //     and the stability of the token economy. Apart from that, this model is
  //     applied in the case of the DAO that facilitates fractional ownership in
  //     real estate and achieves the goal of affordable housing to evaluate its
  //     governance design.
  //     <br />
  //     This study fills the gaps of complex DAO governance simulation by
  //     implementing agent-based modeling, which enables to determine whether a
  //     DAO is robust and sustainable in advance. Besides, based on BDI
  //     architecture, the effects of user heterogeneity, inner state, and
  //     interactions are considered to promote the practicability and accuracy of
  //     this simulation. Finally, this approach simulates the governance design of
  //     a fractional ownership DAO which shows a good result, leading to a new
  //     tool for facilitating DAO’s governance design to enhance equity,
  //     democracy, and efficiency.
